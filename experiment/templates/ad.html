	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.  

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

							    <p>
									The Percepts and Concepts Laboratory at Indiana University is looking for online participants 
									for a brief experiment. This experiment is made up of 40 trials. In each trial you will read a sentence
                           or two in English. 
                           To show that you understand the sentence(s), you
                           will then be asked a question and forced to choose 
                           between two answers. One choice will be much more plausible
                           than the other.
                           The only requirements 
									are that you are at least 18 years old and are a fluent English 
									speaker.  The task will take around 10 to 15 minutes and has a base pay of $0.50. However, to 
                           encourage maximum effort you can earn up to an additional $1.00, prorated depending on how many 
                           questions you answer correctly. Answer all 40 correctly and you get the full $1.00 bonus, miss them all
                           and you get no bonus.
							    </p>
							    <div class="alert alert-danger">
									<strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong> 
									If you have already completed this task before the system will not 
									allow you to run again. If this looks familiar please return the 
									HIT so someone else can participate.
							    </div>
							    <p>
								    Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site 
								    above to begin the task.
								</p>
							    

							{% else %}

								<!-- 
									OTHERWISE
									If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"
									it means the participant has accepted your hit. 
									You should thus show them instructions to begin the 
									experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
									window pointed at your server.

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
									to work.
