            Before you begin, let's practice. This will help you get used to the
            task. It also helps us determine if you are a proficient enough speaker
            of English to be qualified for this task.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <b>Be careful. If you answer
            too many practice questions incorrectly, you will not be allowed to 
            proceed with the task.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            We are interested both in how well you understand the sentences, and
            how quickly you are able to answer. Take your time reading the
            sentences, but then, once the question has been displayed, answer as
            quickly and accurately as you can. However, accuracy is more important
            than speed, so don't rush.
        </p>

            Once the task begins you will not need to use your mouse. All input
            will be done using the keyboard. 
            <b>SPACE</b>, <b>ENTER</b>,
            <b>1</b>, and <b>2</b> are the only keys used. 
            You may find it easiest to keep one hand near the number keys and the
            other near <b>SPACE</b> and <b>ENTER</b>.
        </p>
