		    This task tests your ability to understand ambiguous sentences.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    	You will be presented with 40 examples. In each example you will read
         a short sentence (or two). To see how well you understood
         what you read, you will be
         asked a simple question and forced to pick between two possible answers.
         In each case, one choice should seem much more likely to you than the other.
        </p>

        <p>
         Consider the following example.
        </p>

        <p> <center><h4> Jack runs faster than Bob because he is much taller.  Who is taller? </h4></center> </p>
        <p> <center><h4> <b>1.</b> Jack &nbsp or &nbsp <b>2.</b> Bob </h4></center> </p>

        <p>
         The correct answer is Jack. Jack runs faster than Bob because he is
         much taller and therefore his legs are probably longer. Although it is possible that a very tall 
         person runs more slowly than a shorter person, this is generally not the case.
