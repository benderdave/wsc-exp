</head><body><h2> A Collection of Winograd Schemas </h2>


<p>
A Winograd
schema is a pair of sentences that differ in only one or two words and
that contain an ambiguity that is resolved in  
opposite ways in the two sentences and requires the use of world knowledge
and reasoning for its resolution. The schema takes its name from a
well-known example by Terry Winograd (1972)
</p><blockquote>
The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because
they [feared/advocated] violence.
</blockquote>
If the word is ``feared'', then ``they'' presumably refers to the city council;
if it is ``advocated'' then ``they'' presumably refers to the demonstrators.
(An earlier paper (1971) by Winograd includes another schema, listed as #142
below.)

<p>
In his paper, ``The Winograd Schema Challenge'' Hector
Levesque (2011) proposes to assemble a set of such Winograd schemas that are
</p><ul>
<li> easily disambiguated by the human reader (ideally, so easily that the
reader does not even notice that there is an ambiguity);
</li><li> not solvable by simple techniques such as selectional restrictions;
</li><li> Google-proof; that is, there is no obvious statistical test over 
text corpora that will reliably disambiguate these correctly.
</li></ul>

<p>
The set would then be presented as a challenge for AI programs, along the
lines of the Turing test. The strengths of the challenge are that it is 
clear-cut, in that the
answer to each schema is a binary choice; vivid, in that it is obvious to
non-experts that a program that
fails to get the right answers clearly has serious gaps in its understanding;
and difficult, in that it is far beyond the current state of the art.

</p><p>
This online document presents a collection of 133 Winograd schemas.
Item (1) is the original schema due to Terry Winograd; 
items (2) --- (19) were constructed by Hector Levesque; 
(20) --- (109), (114), (115), (135) and (137) by Ernest Davis;
(110)---(113) by Ray Jackendoff; (116) --- (133) by David Bender; 
(136) from the web page 
<a href="http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/tanka/files/complexities.html">
Linguistic Problems and Complexities</a> by the TANKA group at U. Ottawa;
(138) --- (140) from (Rahman and Ng, 2012), and (141) from (Lenat, 2008).
Item (114) is adapted by Ernest Davis
from a sentence in <em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen. 




</p><p>
We have made a deliberate effort to cover a wide range of world knowledge
and a wide range of linguistic features. At the same time, many of the 
schemas were designed in closely related pairs; these are generally
adjacent in the schema. There did not seem to be any serious drawback
to including pairs of closely related schemas. 

</p><p>
In some cases where we were uncertain whether the schema was Google-proof,
we have done some experiments with searches using Google's count of result
pages. These counts, however, are notoriously unreliable (Lapata and Keller,
2005) so these ``experiments''
should be taken with several grains of salt.

</p><p>
For the ease of machine reading, the text of each example is
bracketed with the HTML tag &lt; text &gt; &lt; /text &gt;. The question is
bracked with &lt; question &gt; &lt; /question &gt;. The answer is bracketed with
&lt; answer &gt; &lt; /answer &gt;.  Comments are bracketed with &lt; remark  &gt;
&lt; /remark &gt;. These tags are invisible in a browser.

</p><p>
There is also 
<a href="https://www.cs.nyu.edu/davise/papers/OldSchemas.xml">
an XML version of this collection,</a> in the same format that would be 
used in an actual running of a challenge. The following differences between
the XML collection and the collection below should be noted:
</p><ul>
<li> Item 113 here, which involves two concurrent
wording changes, and is thus not
in standard format, is omitted in the XML file.
</li><li> Item 135 here, which involves two independent wording changes, has been
broken into three cases in the XML file.
</li></ul>
Consequently, the numbering of examples after #113, is off by 1, in one 
direction or the other.

several of these, though by no means all, fit within the constraints of the
Winograd Schema Challenge. We have incldued

<a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D/D12/D12-1071.pdf">
``Resolving Complex Cases of Definite Pronouns: The Winograd Schema Challenge"
</a>
applied a variety of corpus-based machine learning techniques to the
problem of disambiguating twin sentences. Over a corpus of sentences
developed by 30 undergraduate students, they achieved an overall accuracy
of 73%. That corpus of sentences is

here.</a>

The collection is open, and readers are invited to submit contributions,
which will be added if the editor considers that they satisfy the constraints
and are meaningfully different from the schemas already in the collection.

</p><p> For comparison,
there is also a small <a href="https://www.cs.nyu.edu/davise/papers/WSfailed.html"> collection</a> of examples
that, though interesting, in one way or another fail to meet the bar of
WS schemas. To avoid confusion, these are placed on a separate page.

</p><p> In our published papers, we have a more constrained definition of 
Winograd schema that requires that the ambiguous word is a pronoun and that
the two referents are noun phrases that occur. Some of the schemas below
do not conform to these constraints; these are labelled "Winograd schemas
in the broad sense". 

</p><p>
There are some <a href="https://www.cs.nyu.edu/davise/papers/WS.html#Translations"> links to translations of the schemas

Winograd observes that finding the correct reference resolution would matter

<p>
<remark><b>Comment:</b></remark> There is a large literature on "implicit
causality" and "implicit consequentiality" biases (see, for example, 
(Hartshorne, 2013), (Kehler et al. 2008)), in which a comprehender obtains
a preference for the antecedent of a pronoun in a second clause based on the 
content of the first clause and the connective, <em>before</em> seeing the
content of the second clause. These are often associated with "so" and 
"because". For example seeing:
</p><blockquote>
"Sally frightened Mary because she ..."  people interpret "she" as Sally. <br>
"Sally loves Mary because she ..." people interpret "she" as Mary.  <br>
"Sally frightened Mary, so she ..." people interpret "she" as Mary. <br>
"Sally loves Mary, so she ..." people interpret "she" as Sally. <br>
</blockquote>

<p>
If there are biases that favor the correct disambiguation in our example here,
and if the direction of the biases can be determined purely from linguistic
characteristics of the first clause e.g. from the use of the verb "knew",
then this is not a valid Winograd schema, because an automated understander
could do better than chance on this without employing world knowledge. However,
I currently have no reason to think that this is the case.

<br><answer><b>Answers:</b>Joe's uncle/Joe.</answer>
    
   
<p><remark>
<b>Comment:</b> Note the following results of Google search (1/9/11). 
</remark></p><pre>                          "uncle older"    14,500,000 
                          "uncle younger"   9,630,000 
                          "older"         357,000,000 
                          "younger"        93,000,000

Thus "uncle" is not particularly associated with "older".

<b>Comment:</b> ``Detailed'' would of course be a better word to describe the

<p></p><p><remark>
<b>Comment:</b> 
If you stop the second sentence at "I don't know [who/why] he was" you
still have the same ambiguity, but it becomes very difficult to ask the 
question. "I don't know who <em>who</em> was?'' is perhaps best.
Of course, either way there is a reading in
which the two ``he'' refer to different people, but it seems to me that that's
considerably less preferred.

<br><answer><b>Answers:</b>the sheep/the shepherds.</answer>
<p>
<remark><b>Comment:</b> It may be objected that this can be solved
using the distance in the semantic hierarchy rather than reasoning
about the actual visual appearance. Example <a href="https://www.cs.nyu.edu/davise/papers/WS.html#Lemons">137</a>
below avoids that objection, but is perhaps more difficult for the
human reader. In any case, a program that reasons that similar looking
objects are apt to be close in the semantic hierarchy is, I would say,
solving the problem in a perfectly reasonable way. A program that reasons
ignores the "looks like" relation and just reasons, "The referent of
an anaphora is likely to be close in a semantic hierarchy to some nearby
word in the sentence" is not solving the problem in a reasonable way,
and is employing a fragile heuristic that is easily broken by 
rearranging the sentence. For example, if we reword the
above "Sam tried to paint a picture of shepherds with sheep, 
but they ended up looking to Wilma
more like [dogs/golfers]" where this heuristic will in all cases look
for a referent semantically close to "Wilma".

[childhood/research]. </text>
<question>Who faced difficulties?</question>

<br><answer><b>Answers:</b> Xenophanes/Sam.</answer>


<p><remark>
<b>Comment:</b> 
It is quite possible that "biography" is correlated with "research".
But even if that correlation is detected, there is another non-trivial
step to realize that the research is associated with the author rather
than the subject of the biography.

Emma's mother had died long ago, and her [place had been taken/education had been managed] 
by an excellent woman as governess.
</text>
<question> Whose [place had been taken/education had been managed]?

<br><answer><b> Answers:</b> Emma's mother/Emma.</answer>

<p><remark>
<b>Comment:</b>
The first version is adapted from a sentence in the second paragraph
of Jane Austen's <em> Emma</em>. The original is
</remark></p><blockquote>
Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct
remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been taken by an excellent
woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.
</blockquote>
Note that the original presents two further difficult disambiguation problems,
with the second and third "her"'s in the sentence.
Winograd schema in the broad sense, since two separated words are replaced.

<p><remark>
<b> Comment:</b> 
Simplified version of #69. Like #69, it relies on 
textual coherence for disambiguation; it is, after all, equally true that Jane
did not answer, and that Susan did not get an answer. </remark>

<remark> <b>Comment:</b> The format here is non-standard; this is a 
cross-over,
like a two-way light switch. I am a little doubtful about the intelligibility
of "even though" with "not particularly", but the rest seem fine to me.
David Bender points out that the difficulty in that case may be due to the
fact that it is hard to find a motivation for George. Winograd schema in
